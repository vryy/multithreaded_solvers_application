This directory contains sample programs to illustrate how to use
various functions provded in SuperLU_MT. The users can modify these templates
to suit their applications. The command line option "nprocs" indicates the 
number of processes to be used. If this option is not provided at the 
command line, the programs will run on a single processor.

1. To run example calling simple driver xGSSV:
        % pslinsol -p [nprocs] < g10
        % pdlinsol -p [nprocs] < g10
        % pclinsol -p [nprocs] < cmat
        % pzlinsol -p [nprocs] < cmat

2. To run example calling expert driver xGSSVX: 
	% pslinsolx -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pdlinsolx -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pclinsolx -p [nprocs] < cmat
	% pzlinsolx -p [nprocs] < cmat

3. To run example that performs repeated factorizations for the matrix
   with the same sparsity pattern:
	% psrepeat -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pdrepeat -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pcrepeat -p [nprocs] < cmat
	% pzrepeat -p [nprocs] < cmat

4. To run example that integrates with other multithreaded application,
   but threads are created only once:
	% psspmd -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pdspmd -p [nprocs] < g10
	% pcspmd -p [nprocs] < cmat
	% pzspmd -p [nprocs] < cmat

5. To use Fortran interface, do the following:
        1) make f77exm
    	2) f77exm -p [nprocs] < g10
